## Check if All Leaves are at the Same Level in Binary Tree

### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree with `n` nodes, determine whether all the leaf nodes are at the same level or not. Return true if all leaf nodes are at the same level, and false otherwise.

#### Your Task:

Implement the function `check()` that checks whether all the leaf nodes in the given binary tree are at the same level or not. The function takes the root node of the tree as an input and should return a boolean value (`true`/`false`) based on the condition.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(height of tree)

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
