## LCS of three strings

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lcs-of-three-strings0028/1

Given 3 strings `A`, `B` and `C`, the task is to find the length of the longest sub-sequence that is common in all the three given strings.
 <br>
### Example 1: <br>

**Input:** <br>
A = "geeks" <br>
B = "geeksfor",  <br>
C = "geeksforgeeks" <br>

**Output:** 5 <br>

**Explanation:** <br> 
"geeks"is the longest common 
subsequence with length 5. <br>

### Example 2: <br>

**Input:** <br> 
A = "abcd" <br>
B = "efgh" <br>
C = "ijkl" <br>

**Output:** 0 <br>

**Explanation:** <br> 
There's no subsequence common
in all the three strings. <br>
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `LCSof3()` which takes the strings `A`, `B`, `C` and their lengths `n1`, `n2`, `n3` as input and returns the length of the longest common subsequence in all the 3 strings.
 <br>
Expected Time Complexity: O(n1*n2*n3). <br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n1*n2*n3). <br>

Constraints: <br>
1 <= n1, n2, n3 <= 20 <br>
Elements of the strings consitutes only of the lower case english alphabets. <br>
