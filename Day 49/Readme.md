## Largest Sum Subarray of Size at least K

Given an array `a` of length `n` and a number `k`, find the largest sum of the subarray containing at least `k` numbers. It is guaranteed that the size of the array is at least `k`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
n = 4  
a[] = {1, -2, 2, -3}  
k = 2  

**Output:**  
1  

**Explanation:**  
The sub-array of length at least 2 that produces the greatest sum is {1, -2, 2}.

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
n = 6  
a[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}  
k = 2  

**Output:**  
6  

**Explanation:**  
The sub-array of length at least 2 that produces the greatest sum is {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}.

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `maxSumWithK()` which takes the array `a[]`, its size `n`, and an integer `k` as inputs and returns the value of the largest sum of the subarray containing at least `k` numbers.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)  
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

**Constraints:**  
1 <= n <= 10^5  
-10^5 <= a[i] <= 10^5  
1 <= k <= n
