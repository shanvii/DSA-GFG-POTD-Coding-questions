## Count Nodes at Distance K from Leaf in Binary Tree

### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree with `n` nodes and a non-negative integer `k`, the task is to count the number of special nodes. A node is considered special if there exists at least one leaf in its subtree such that the distance between the node and leaf is exactly `k`.

### Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Complete the function `printKDistantfromLeaf()` that takes root node and `k` as inputs and returns the number of nodes that are at distance `k` from a leaf node.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n).
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(Height of the Tree).

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 10^5

#### Input Format

You don't need to read input. The function `printKDistantfromLeaf()` will take the root node of the binary tree and the integer `k` as inputs.

#### Output Format

The function should return an integer representing the number of nodes that are at distance `k` from a leaf node.
