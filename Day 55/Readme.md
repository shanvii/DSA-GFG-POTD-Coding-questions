## Merge 2 sorted linked list in reverse order

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-2-sorted-linked-list-in-reverse-order/1

Given two linked lists of size `N` and `M`, which are sorted in non-decreasing order. The task is to merge them in such a way that the resulting list is in non-increasing order.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
N = 2, M = 2
list1 = 1->3
list2 = 2->4

**Output:**
4->3->2->1

**Explanation:**
After merging the two lists in non-increasing order, we have new lists as 4->3->2->1.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
N = 4, M = 3
list1 = 5->10->15->40 
list2 = 2->3->20

**Output:**
40->20->15->10->5->3->2

**Explanation:**
After merging the two lists in non-increasing order, we have new lists as 40->20->15->10->5->3->2.

**Your Task:**
The task is to complete the function mergeResult() which takes reference to the heads of both linked list and returns the pointer to the merged linked list.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N+M)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= N, M <= 10^4
